## 🔥 Advanced Tips

### A/B Testing Your Outreach
Test these variables:
1. **Subject lines:** Risk vs. Value vs. Curiosity
2. **Email length:** Short (100 words) vs. Medium (150 words)
3. **CTA:** Call request vs. Free audit vs. Case study
4. **Send time:** Morning vs. Afternoon
5. **Personalization level:** Generic vs. Highly specific

Track results in your notes field!

### Warming Up Cold Leads
Before emailing:
1. Follow their company on LinkedIn
2. Engage with their content (like/comment)
3. Connect with their team members
4. Mention this in your outreach

### Creating Urgency (Ethically)
- "I'm doing free audits for 3 pet e-commerce companies this month"
- "ADA lawsuits in pet industry increased 40% this quarter"
- "Limited availability for onboarding before Q1"
- "Special pricing for companies who commit by [date]"

### Multi-Threading
Don't rely on one contact:
1. Start with primary contact role
2. If no response after 2 touches, try secondary contact
3. Connect with multiple stakeholders
4. Someone will engage eventually
